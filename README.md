# 🐍 **FR Python Snake Game**
### A sleek, modular, object-oriented Python Snake game engineered to showcase strong development fundamentals, scalable architecture, and real-time game logic.

> Python Snake game built with **OOP and multi-module design**.  

> Features optimized game loop, **inheritance, dynamic object spawning, collision logic, and modular architecture**.  

> Built to showcase **scalable code structure and core development principles**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

This project was built with a focus on **architecture over flashiness**, proving strong understanding of:

- Multi-class systems with clear responsibility separation  
- **Inheritance** (`Food` and `Scoreboard` extend `Turtle`)  
- Stable and optimized **real-time game loop**  
- Collision detection (food, walls, self-body)  
- **Randomized dynamic object spawning** (food placement)  
- Modular Python file architecture  


## 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

| Concept | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| OOP | `Snake` & `Scoreboard` using classes |
| Inheritance | `Food(Turtle)` subclass |
| Game Loop | Efficient `while play` loop with `screen.tracer(0)` |
| Modularity | Separate logic files for `snake`, `food`, and `scoreboard` |
| Collision Logic | `.distance()` checks for wall, food & tail |
| Error Prevention | Heading restriction to prevent 180° turns |
| Random Object Spawning | `randint()` coordinate generation |

## 🧩 Module Responsibilities

**main.py**
- Initializes screen, snake, food, scoreboard
- Handles keyboard input listeners
- Runs game loop & collision detection
    
**snake.py**
- Builds snake body using loops
- Moves snake using reverse iteration
- Prevents invalid 180° turning
- Implements extend() for growth
    
**food.py**
- Inherits core traits from Turtle
- Spawns in random screen positions with RNG
    
**scoreboard.py**
- Displays current score at top of screen
- Updates score using a class method
- Triggers Game Over display when called


## How to Run

    git clone https://github.com/fernandogrh/Snake_Game.git
    cd Snake_Game
    python main.py
